# Temperature Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds a comprehensive temperature monitoring feature to the ESP32-S3 BLE GATT server, fulfilling all requirements from the issue:

### ✅ Requirements Met

1. **Implemented temperature query (fake it for now)** ✓
   - Created `TemperatureService` class that generates fake temperature values
   - Temperature ranges from 17.5°C to 27.5°C using pseudo-random variation
   - Clean separation of concerns with dedicated temperature service module

2. **Report temperature over BLE** ✓
   - Integrated with BLE GATT server
   - Temperature data exposed through BLE characteristics
   - Values sent as signed 16-bit integers (multiplied by 100 for precision)

3. **Use appropriate UUID for service and characteristics** ✓
   - **Environmental Sensing Service**: `0000181A-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Standard BLE UUID 0x181A)
   - **Temperature Characteristic**: `00002A6E-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Standard BLE UUID 0x2A6E)
   - **Max Temperature**: `00002A6F-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
   - **Min Temperature**: `00002A70-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
   - **Temperature Config**: `00002A71-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

4. **Report temperature every 30 seconds, max temp, low temp** ✓
   - Temperature updates every 30 seconds automatically
   - Tracks and reports current, maximum, and minimum temperatures
   - Sends BLE notifications to connected clients every 30 seconds

5. **Provide way to configure so we can set Fahrenheit or Celsius** ✓
   - Temperature Config characteristic allows unit selection
   - Write `0` for Celsius, `1` for Fahrenheit
   - All temperature values (current, max, min) are converted when unit changes
   - Unit configuration is readable and writable via BLE

## Files Created

1. **include/temperature_service.h** - Temperature service interface
2. **src/temperature_service.cpp** - Temperature service implementation
3. **test/test_temperature_service.cpp** - Unit tests for temperature service
4. **docs/TEMPERATURE_SERVICE.md** - Comprehensive usage documentation

## Files Modified

1. **include/ble_server.h** - Added temperature service UUIDs and methods
2. **src/ble_server.cpp** - Integrated temperature service into BLE server
3. **src/main.cpp** - Added temperature service initialization and updates
4. **README.md** - Updated with temperature feature documentation

## Key Features

### Temperature Service
- **Fake Temperature Generation**: Generates realistic temperature values for testing
- **Update Interval**: 30 seconds between updates
- **Min/Max Tracking**: Automatically tracks minimum and maximum since startup
- **Unit Conversion**: Seamless conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- **Thread-Safe Design**: Uses static members suitable for embedded systems

### BLE Integration
- **Standard UUIDs**: Uses official Environmental Sensing Service (0x181A)
- **Multiple Characteristics**: Separate characteristics for current, max, min, and config
- **Notifications**: Pushes updates to connected clients automatically
- **Read/Write Support**: Clients can read values and configure units

### Data Format
- **16-bit Integer**: Temperature * 100 (e.g., 22.50°C = 2250)
- **Signed Values**: Supports negative temperatures
- **Little-Endian**: Standard BLE byte order
- **Precision**: 0.01° resolution (two decimal places)

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests cover:
- Temperature service initialization
- Unit conversion accuracy (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Min/Max temperature tracking
- UUID format validation
- Unit getter/setter functionality

Run tests with: `pio test -e native`

## Usage Example

### Connect and Read Temperature (nRF Connect App)
1. Scan and connect to "ESP32-S3-BLE-Device"
2. Find Environmental Sensing Service (0x181A)
3. Read Current Temperature characteristic (0x2A6E)
4. Value will be a 2-byte signed integer (divide by 100)

### Change to Fahrenheit
1. Find Temperature Config characteristic (0x2A71)
2. Write value `01` (hex)
3. All temperatures will now be in Fahrenheit

### Enable Notifications
1. Enable notifications on Current Temperature
2. Receive updates every 30 seconds
3. Also available for Max and Min characteristics

## Architecture

```
main.cpp
  ├─> TemperatureService::init()        // Initialize fake sensor
  └─> BLEServerManager::init()          // Setup BLE services
       └─> Create Environmental Sensing Service
            ├─> Current Temperature (Read, Notify)
            ├─> Max Temperature (Read, Notify)
            ├─> Min Temperature (Read, Notify)
            └─> Temperature Config (Read, Write)

loop()
  ├─> TemperatureService::update()      // Update every 30s
  ├─> BLEServerManager::updateTemperature()  // Update BLE values
  └─> BLEServerManager::notifyTemperature()  // Send notifications every 30s
```

## Standards Compliance

This implementation follows Bluetooth SIG specifications:
- **Service**: Environmental Sensing Service (0x181A)
- **Characteristic**: Temperature (0x2A6E)
- **Data Format**: org.bluetooth.unit.thermodynamic_temperature.degree_celsius

## Future Enhancements

While this implementation meets all requirements, possible enhancements include:
- Integration with real temperature sensors (DHT22, BME280, DS18B20)
- Non-volatile storage of min/max values
- Configurable update intervals
- Temperature alarms/thresholds
- Historical data logging
- Humidity and pressure sensing

## Minimal Changes Approach

The implementation follows best practices for minimal code changes:
- ✅ Existing BLE server structure preserved
- ✅ Original demo characteristic still functional
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Clean modular design with separate temperature service
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation added
- ✅ Unit tests added without disrupting existing tests
